Filtering Data:
    Integer/Float
    -searching for direct integer/float numbers can be done by giving an exact number input, for example entering 850 in the Linie Gui entry
    -searching integer/floats with assignment operators like <=, <, >=, ect. is possible. For example by entering <= 850 in the Linie Gui entry


    Strings
    -Searching for exact strings is possible by adding a == before the word, for example ==AD in the abkuerzung Bahnhof will yield all results consisting of exactly AD
    -Searching string containing a word, but not exactly the word is possible by entering the word into the Gui, for example AD in the abkuerzung Bahnhof will yield all results containing AD
