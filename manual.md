## Filtering Data:

### Integer/Float input
    -searching for exact integer/float numbers can be done by giving an exact number input, for example entering 850 in the Linie Gui entry
    -searching integer/floats with assignment operators like <=, <, >=, ect. is possible. For example by entering <=850 in the Linie Gui entry


### Word/String input
    -Searching for exact strings is possible by adding a == before the word, for example ==AD in the abkuerzung Bahnhof will yield all results consisting of exactly AD
    -Searching strings containing a word is possible by entering the word into the Gui, for example AD in the abkuerzung Bahnhof will yield all results containing AD
